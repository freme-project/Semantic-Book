# Semantic Book

## Usage

We provided steps (as can be seen in the folder structure) to create the Semantic Book. In each folder you can find a README where it is explained what needs to be done.
Especially, don't forget to do `npm install` in folder `step-3`.

## E-reader Support

The Semantic Book is only tested with [Readium](http://readium.org/) in Chrome.
